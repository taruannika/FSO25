# FullStackOpen Part1

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

## What I Learned

### React Components
- **Functional Components**: I learned how to create functional components in React. Each component is a JavaScript function that returns a React element.
- **Props**: I learned how to pass data to components using props. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
- **State Management**: I learned how to manage state using the `useState` hook.
